    Pre-ovulation begins with the first day of menstruation and ends with ovulation. During menstruation, eggs in the ovaries are maturing. Usually only one becomes fully mature. When the egg is mature, it is released from the ovary. This is called ovulation. Girls and women are fertile for about five days before and one day after ovulation. 

    The length of pre-ovulation varies a lot among women and from one cycle to the next. It is usually between 13-18 days long but can be as short as 8 days or as long as 31 days, depending on how long your menstrual cycle is. 

    The second part of the cycle, post-ovulation, starts after ovulation and ends the day before your next period starts. It is usually 10-15 days long, but it can be from 6 to 16 days long.

    When you log in for the first time, Period Tracker App will ask you to choose a passcode. You will need to remember it for the next time you log in. You can change this passcode at any time by going to your user profile.

    To be extra sure that no one else can log in but you, Period Tracker App uses an additional way to protect your information. 

    When you sign up, Period Tracker App asks you to select a secret question and a secret answer, to use in case you forget your passcode. You can change this at any time from your user profile once you are logged in. The secret questions are designed to be things that only you know about yourself, but cannot be guessed by other people. If you forget your passcode, Period Tracker App will ask you for your secret answer to make sure it is really you logging in. Period Tracker App will never display your secret question on screen. If someone else tries to log into your account, they will not be able to because they do not know the answer to your secret question. Make sure you do not share this with anyone!

    Only you can reset your passcode and secret question and answer, so make sure you do not forget it. Period Tracker App takes your privacy very seriously, that is why we cannot reset it for you. Make sure you note down your passcode, secret question and secret answer somewhere private, so that you can always remember it.',	'2020-11-04 06:58:26.282',	'1',	'en'),

Both semen and urine or pee leave the body through the hole at the tip of the penis. Usually the penis is soft and hangs down. Sometimes it fills with blood and becomes harder, larger and longer and stands out from the body. This is called an erection.

For cycles that are usually 21-24 days long, ovulation usually occurs 9-13 days before the first day of the next menstrual period. For cycles that are usually 15-20 days long, ovulation occurs 6-10 days before the start of the next period.

    Everybody is different, and variations in your cycle are normal. When girls first start to get periods, their menstrual cycle is often not regular. Periods can come one month and not the next, or come only a couple of weeks apart. 

    It may take a few years before a girl’s cycle is more regular. Comparing your cycle to others, or what''s ''normal'' can make you feel there''s something wrong, although everything is probably OK. 

    Using Period Tracker App to track your period will help you see what is normal for YOU. If you notice something unusual for you personally, then it probably is a good idea to talk to a grown up you trust, and a doctor.',	'2019-12-11 16:00:37.146',	'1',	'en'),

    5. Underarm hair grows.
    6. Sweat changes and has a stronger smell. 
    7. Facial hair starts to grow.

    Boys also grow taller, often suddenly, and their muscles grow. Their skin becomes oilier, causing pimples or acne. Some boys’ ''breasts'' also grow a bit, but this goes away in a year or two.

    The vagina is a small but stretchy passageway that leads from a small opening between the legs to the womb (uterus). Your period blood leaves your body through the vagina, and so do babies. When you have sex, the penis goes into the vagina, and if the man ejaculates, the semen swims through the vagina and into the womb or uterus. 

    The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the womb or uterus that hangs down into the top of the vagina. It has a small hole that  period blood comes through. After sex (without a condom), semen passes into the womb through it. During birth, it stretches open, allowing the baby to go through, but during sex, the penis doesn''t go any further than the cervix. The cervix protects the woman’s uterus from germs!

    The uterus or womb is made of strong, stretchy muscles and is hollow inside. It is connected to fallopian tubes at the top, and to the vagina at the bottom. It is where a developing baby (called a fetus) grows, is fed and protected during pregnancy. It has a lining that gets thick with blood and tissue during your menstrual cycle, and then trickles out during your period. 

    The fallopian tubes are two very narrow tubes at the top of the womb or uterus that lead towards the ovaries. Their ends are like fingers (called fimbria) that pull the egg from the ovary into the tube! The egg and sperm meet in one of the fallopian tubes and then travel to the womb. 

    The two ovaries are the size of grapes. They are on each side of the womb or uterus near the end of the fallopian tubes. They make female hormones (natural chemicals), and are where women''s eggs grow.',	'2020-03-23 03:30:06.706',	'1',	'en'),

    The testicles are the two balls inside the scrotum (a bag of skin) that sit between men''s legs, under the penis. They are  the size of two small eggs that make hormones (natural chemicals) and sperm.

    The epididymis is a tiny, tightly coiled tube, that sits on top of each testicle. Sperm travel through and mature inside of them. 

    The vas deferens are two long, thin tubes that start at the epididymis and go all the way to the urethra. Sperm from the epididymis travel through them.

    The seminal vesicles are two small glands that make fluid. When sperm get to the seminal vesicles, they mix with this fluid, which feeds and protects them.

    The prostate gland makes a thin, milky fluid that mixes with sperm and the fluid from the seminal vesicles to make semen. 

    The urethra is a thin tube that goes from the bladder through the penis. It carries urine or pee and semen out of the body.

    The two Cowper’s glands are near the urethra. They make a fluid called pre-ejaculate. When urine or pee passes through the urethra, it leaves acid in it that can kill sperm. The pre-ejaculate flows through the urethra before the sperm and makes it safe for the sperm so they can live.',	'2020-03-23 03:31:53.11',	'1',	'en'),

    I am a start-up company that will be selling organic teen period products in the UK aiming at teens starting their periods. I really like what I am seeing on the app for our young girls. Is it possible to tweak the app a little bit to be suitable for the UK market? I am interested in the possibility of linking the app with my product to give girls the chance to understand and track their periods from a young age. It is possible to do this using the source code?

    I''m Minjung Choi who is an undergraduate in Seoul National University. I''m recently conducting a research on Korean girls'' menstruation. There are lots of girls who can''t tell their menstruation to anybody so that they have hard time in facing their first menstruation. Thus, I am doing my best to solve this problem by making them be able to open their mind and tell their concerns to ''menstruation seniors''. To do so, I found out that the platform those girls can approach should be easy and attractive to them. While looking for those platforms, I found Period Tracker App and then used it. Period Tracker App is quite comfortable as well as informative enough for girls to understand and track their period in line with their healthy life! Therefore, I want to know how Period Tracker App select information for girls and how Period Tracker App delivers their message and information to girls who are hard to approach for me because they are too young to read books or listen to some formal lecture. If you don''t mind, would you please help me to solve Korean Girls'' Menstruation problem? I''m sure you will give me some brilliant insight in my study. I''m waiting for your reply. Thank you:)',	'en'),

    I was recently challenged to help a younger cousin with questions about menstruation and body development and was faced with a major barrier between amazing cycle tracking apps, that don´t really cover the as much important phase between childhood and pre-adolescence. 

    When I found your app (while I was checking to start one myself) I realized you only have three languages available.

    That said, I would like to formally request if you could develop a translation to Portuguese, if not possible I would like to volunteer, if possible, to translate the app for you, as I am a  Portuguese native and use English as a second language. 
    Please come back to me as I would love to be helpful in this matter and give even more freedom to this amazing project that you created!!

    Lots of love to you people.
    And thank you for having this amazing idea!
