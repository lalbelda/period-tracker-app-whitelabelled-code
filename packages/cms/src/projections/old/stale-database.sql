Sometimes it fills with blood and becomes harder, larger and longer, which is called an erection.

The scrotum is a soft bag of squishy skin that hangs behind the penis. It holds and protects the two testicles and the epididymis (which stores and transports semen).',	'2020-03-23 03:31:21.696',	'1',	'en'),

If you feel like that, it''s fine (although if he''s a teacher or much older than you, you should tell a trusted adult, even if you have a crush on him). 

But if he makes you feel uncomfortable, annoyed, humiliated, angry, upset, scared or powerless, and he keeps doing it when you''ve asked them to stop, that''s called sexual harassment. 

Sexual harassment can include:

- Unwelcome touching, hugging or kissing

- Demanding something sexual in exchange for something like a grade, job or promotion

- Using sexual threats to get something

- Staring in a sexual way

- Unwanted sexual comments or jokes

- Unwanted invitations to have sex or repeatedly asking someone to go out on dates

- Unwanted questions about a person’s private life or body

- Sexual insults 

- Showing or sending you sexual photos, pictures, videos or messages

- Stalking (when someone repeatedly watches, follows or harasses you)

Sexual harassment is WRONG and a violation of human rights because it''s a type of sexual violence.

Remember, men and boys don''t get to decide whether it''s ''just flirting'' or if it''s sexual harassment, you do. ',	'2020-12-14 04:03:35.362',	'1',	'en'),

1. Complain directly to the person or organization and ask or demand that your rights be respected

2. If someone like a doctor or police officer is violating your rights as part of their work, complain officially to the organization that monitors them

3. Use mediation, where a trained, skilled neutral third party helps you to resolve the issue 

4. Make a complaint to the National Commission on Human Rights in your country, which is there to protect, develop, and promote human rights in the constitution and in the treaties that your country signed

5. Speak to a lawyer, a legal services group (who can help you get a lawyer) or an NGO to see if you can take your case to court

6. If you''re willing to speak out in public, reach out to the media. For example, Malala Yousafzai became internationally famous for drawing attention to girls rights'' abuses in Pakistan

7. Become an advocate to create awareness and action. Organizations that campaign for the rights of women and children include Amnesty International, UN Women and One.org',	'2020-12-14 04:17:10.057',	'1',	'en'),

Sexual assault is when you haven''t agreed to do something, or you can''t agree because you''re drunk, high on drugs, asleep or unconscious, or because you don''t understand. 

Any sexual behavior with someone who who is legally too young to consent (agree) is sexual abuse, even if you say yes.

Sexual abuse can come from someone you trust — a father, brother, uncle or family friend — or a stranger. They may tell you to keep it secret but it is important to tell a parent or teacher.

If you think you''ve been sexually assaulted or abused, talk to someone you trust. Sometimes just confiding in someone is enough to make you feel better, but if you want to make sure that person doesn''t hurt you or others again, you might decide to report them.

If the family is poor, it means 1 less person to feed, clothe and educate.

They might think that investing in their sons’ education is more worthwhile since sons will stay and support them, whereas daughters will go to live with their husbands’ families.

Parents can think that marrying their daughter young will keep her, her virginity, and the family’s honor safe. For example, if a girl gets pregnant before marriage, the parents might see marriage as the only solution.

In some places, child marriage has been done for so long that it just seems normal. 

Boys can also be married as children, but it happens much less. Almost no boys are married before they''re 15. 

Having laws against child marriage is a big step in making it stop happening, or happen less. 

Sadly, having a law that says something isn''t allowed, doesn''t always mean that it doesn''t happen anymore.

For laws to work, family, communities and the authorities (like police, or the government) need to know about the law, understand it, follow it and make sure there are serious consequences when the law isn''t followed.',	'2020-12-14 04:19:56.331',	'1',	'en'),

If you''re under 18, sharing nude or sexual images of a minor online, on a phone, by mail or in any other way is illegal in most countries. 

Pictures of minors are considered to be child pornography and sharing them can have serious legal and life-changing consequences for those who took the picture, shared it or requested it. Even if it''s a picture of yourself.

If someone you like asks you to share a private photo or video, tell them that it makes you feel uncomfortable. 

If they really care about you, they''ll understand. If anyone tries to threaten you into sharing anything, say no and block them. Document it by taking a screenshot.

In some countries, it is legal to get married under 18, but this is still child marriage.

Even in countries where child marriage is legal, a forced or arranged marriage is a violation of a child''s rights.

Why? 

Firstly, because everyone has the right to choose if, when and who they marry — and children don''t have that choice.

Children also have the right to education, health, equality and a life without violence, but child marriage often prevents them from getting those things.

Children who marry usually leave school, which makes it difficult for them to find good jobs and to make enough money. This limits their future.

Married girls are likely to become pregnant before their bodies have finished growing, which puts their health and life at risk. 

Child brides are also more likely to experience violence in their marriage. 

When married girls are abused, it can be more difficult for them to leave the abusive marriage because of their age and lack of life experience, and the abuse can cause mental health problems.

Child brides might also be isolated, and have little power, especially if their husbands are older than them, which happens a lot.

Finally, the children of child brides are also affected. Babies born to teenage mothers are also more likely to die soon after being born, and if they survive, are often less educated. ',	'2020-12-14 04:19:13.293',	'1',	'en'),

The most common way people self-harm is by cutting themselves. Some people bang or hit their heads, burn or scratch themselves, punch themselves or other things, pull out their hair or pick at wounds to prevent them from healing.

Self-harm can also include less violent things, like taking a lot of drugs, drinking too much, or eating too much or too little.

Most people who self-harm feel shame and guilt about hurting themselves, but find it hard to stop. 

People often try to keep it a secret, but it''s quite common, especially for teenagers. That doesn''t mean it''s OK!

Hurting yourself or thinking about hurting yourself is a sign that something is wrong emotionally.

It''s important to learn healthy ways to cope with emotional pain.

The first step is to talk to a parent, trusted adult, psychologist or counsellor. Check Period Tracker App''s Health Center for organizations you can contact.

If you think a friend may be self-harming, you can:

- Let your friend know that if they feel down or stressed, they can talk to you

- Tell your friend you''re worried about them, and why.If your friend seems angry or upset, it’s probably because they feel ashamed and are scared to stop. People learn to rely on self-harming to cope with life''s struggles

- Encourage your friend to seek help from their parent, a counsellor or doctor or another adult they trust

- If you''re worried for your friend’s safety and decide you need to tell an adult, let your friend know before you say anything

- Continue being their friend by showing support, doing the things you enjoy doing together, and letting your friend know that you accept them for who they are',	'2020-12-14 04:29:05.316',	'1',	'en'),

It might take longer for you to accept yourself or you might still struggle with negative judgments from family, friends or community.

- Hair grows on the genitals, usually a few months later

- The voice begins to get deeper

- The first ejaculation happens usually about a year after the testicles begin to grow. Many (but not all) boys have wet dreams, which is when they ejaculate while sleeping

- Underarm hair grows

- Sweat changes and has a stronger smell

- Facial hair starts to grow

Boys also grow taller, often suddenly, and their muscles grow. Their skin becomes oilier, causing pimples or acne. Some boys’ ''breasts'' also grow a bit, but this goes away in a year or so.

Here are some questions to think about:  

1. How well does the method work? The methods that work the best in preventing pregnancy are the contraceptive injection, implant, the IUD and the contraceptive pill. 

2. How easy is it to use? The easiest methods to use are the contraceptive injection, implant, and IUD because after you get them, you don''t need to remember anything until the next time it needs to be replaced/injected. If you pick the implant or IUD, you can use it for years! 

3. What methods can you get? In some places, it may be difficult or even impossible for teenagers to get certain methods, like the implant, injection or IUD, because they need to go to a family planning clinic to get them and those services can be only for married women or they may be too far away or too expensive for a young person, if they have to pay.

If that is your situation, use the method you can get that works the best and is the easiest to use. You can get condoms almost everywhere, often for free, and in some places you can buy the contraceptive pill in a pharmacy. Don''t let shyness stop you from buying what you need to protect yourself!

4. What methods will work for your body? Some girls and women can''t use one or more methods for a health reason. A health care worker can advise you about this. 

Remember, you have to use condoms as well to prevent STIs, including HIV. 

If no other method is available, using withdrawal is much better than no method at all. However, it is much safer to wait to have sex until you have another more effective method to use!',	'2020-03-23 06:23:59.99',	'0',	'en'),

The seminal vesicles are 2 small glands that make fluid. When sperm get to the seminal vesicles, they mix with this fluid, which feeds and protects them.

The prostate gland makes a thin, milky fluid that mixes with sperm and the fluid from the seminal vesicles to make semen.

The urethra is a thin tube that goes from the bladder through the penis. It carries pee and semen out of the body.

There are 2 Cowper’s glands near the urethra that make a fluid called pre-ejaculate (which comes out just before ejaculation) which acts as a natural lubricant during sex. ',	'2020-03-23 03:31:53.11',	'1',	'en'),

The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the womb, at the top of the vagina. Period blood passes from the womb, through the cervix into the vagina. After sex (without a condom), semen passes through the cervix, into the womb. During birth, the cervix stretches open, allowing the baby to pass through.

The womb is made of strong, stretchy muscles and is empty inside. It is connected to the fallopian tubes at the top, and to the vagina at the bottom. It is where a baby grows during pregnancy. It has a lining that gets thick with blood and tissue during your menstrual cycle, and then trickles out during your period.

The fallopian tubes are 2 very narrow tubes at the top of the womb or uterus that lead towards the ovaries. Their ends are like fingers (called fimbria) that pull the egg from the ovary into the tube. The egg and sperm meet in 1 of the fallopian tubes and then travel to the womb.

If your country has signed all of these treaties, it means those rights are recognized by your country and the government has agreed to fulfil them.

Unfortunately, even though a country has signed a treaty, they sometimes face difficulties making sure rights are fully respected.',	'2020-12-14 04:14:44.453',	'1',	'en'),

- Become the change in your community and speak up against it. Things don''t have to stay the way they are!

- Educate yourself more on child marriage. For example, learn about child marriage laws in your country

- Join or set up a support network in your community to help girls who are being pressured to marry

- Find out about the services near you, like child protection services or NGOs

- Create a space where girls can meet and share their experiences safely

- If you have married friends who feel isolated, invite them to join. If they can''t join a group, stay in touch and help to connect them to services and support

- Organize community conversations to educate people about child marriage. Remember to include fathers, brothers and other boys 

- Use theater, art or music to show the reality of child marriage

- Use social media to raise awareness of girls’ rights and the harms caused by child marriage

- Support girls’ right to complete their education and to access youth-friendly health services',	'2020-12-14 04:21:44.89',	'1',	'en'),

But you''re not alone — 1 in 5 people will have suicidal thoughts at some point in their life.

Sometimes life can be so overwhelming, it''s sometimes impossible to believe that anything will get better.

But many people who have thought about suicide found that those feelings did go away with time, and they were glad they didn''t do it.

You should talk to someone as soon as possible. This could be a family member, friend, counsellor, doctor or support service. Check Period Tracker App''s Help Center for organizations to contact. 

Some other thing you can do:

- Develop a safety plan. If you''ve had suicidal thoughts in the past, plan ahead for how to manage them if they come up again

- Postpone any decision to end your life for 24 hours. Use this time to talk to someone you trust

- Avoid being alone, especially at night. Stay with someone until the thoughts of hurting yourself don''t feel so strong

- Don''t drink or take drugs. These are what''s called ''depressants'' and actually make you feel worse, even if you feel better for a short time

- Write down how you feel. Writing in a journal or writing a story, song or poem can help you to understand your feelings better and find solutions

- Challenge your thoughts. Remember that, just like other thoughts, suicidal thoughts will come and go and thinking something doesn''t make it true.

- Write down what is keeping you from acting on suicidal thoughts. Remind yourself that there are things that you still want to do. Even tiny things make life worth living.

- Set small goals for yourself. Set goals that will make you feel in control and move forward. Write them down and check them off when you achieve them.

- Talk to someone who can help. That advice is so important Period Tracker App is mentioning it twice!',	'2020-12-14 04:30:11.48',	'1',	'en'),

I''m Minjung Choi who is an undergraduate in Seoul National University. I''m recently conducting a research on Korean girls'' menstruation. There are lots of girls who can''t tell their menstruation to anybody so that they have hard time in facing their first menstruation. Thus, I am doing my best to solve this problem by making them be able to open their mind and tell their concerns to ''menstruation seniors''. To do so, I found out that the platform those girls can approach should be easy and attractive to them. While looking for those platforms, I found Period Tracker App and then used it. Period Tracker App is quite comfortable as well as informative enough for girls to understand and track their period in line with their healthy life! Therefore, I want to know how Period Tracker App select information for girls and how Period Tracker App delivers their message and information to girls who are hard to approach for me because they are too young to read books or listen to some formal lecture. If you don''t mind, would you please help me to solve Korean Girls'' Menstruation problem? I''m sure you will give me some brilliant insight in my study. I''m waiting for your reply. Thank you:)',	'en'),

I was recently challenged to help a younger cousin with questions about menstruation and body development and was faced with a major barrier between amazing cycle tracking apps, that don´t really cover the as much important phase between childhood and pre-adolescence. 

When I found your app (while I was checking to start one myself) I realized you only have three languages available.

That said, I would like to formally request if you could develop a translation to Portuguese, if not possible I would like to volunteer, if possible, to translate the app for you, as I am a  Portuguese native and use English as a second language. 
Please come back to me as I would love to be helpful in this matter and give even more freedom to this amazing project that you created!!

Lots of love to you people.
And thank you for having this amazing idea!

Many thanks and best,
Rita

I am trying to recover my 10 year old daughter''s account, which I loaded onto my phone for her when she started her period a few months ago. I cannot get into the account because I do not remember the password and I do not know what the secret question is, thus I cannot answer the secret question. I cannot even delete the account without this information. 

I downloaded this app because it is age-appropriate for a young adolescent. However, I am throroughly disappointed with password design and more, the lack of assistance in this matter. 

If I do not receive assistance within 48 hours, I will submit a negative review and report the app to Google. 

thank you',	'en'),

I don''t like my body, but my parents won''t let me change it. I''ve even thought about making myself throw up to get rid of the unhealthy food they tell me to eat. I''ve never actually done it, but I don''t want to go in that direction. I talked to my mom about it already, but she just said my body looks fine and the dood we eat isn''t unhealthy, it''s just affordable. I know  she probably said that to make me feel better, but it only made me feel worse about hating my body.  Please help!

Gender suggestions & meanings
Demigirl- only a little bit girl
Demibiy- only a little bit boy
Demibinary- only a little bit non binary 
Trigender- 3 genders at once
Bigender- 2 genders at once
Polygender- almost all genders at once
Pangender- all genders at once
Agender- no gender at all
Netrious- netral gender 
Fae and faer gender- ( I think thats what their called, sorry, one is only masculine genders and the other is only feminine genders)
There is probably more that have not been listed, but this is as good as I could do. Please consider adding these and there definitions, it would mean so much to me!

I think it would be really great if you made your app to include girls BEFORE menarche as their bodies are changing and if they could track when they are having cervical changes (discharge) it might help them to prepare for their first period - might take a lot of anxiety out of it 👌🏼
Think about it maybe. 
I have lots of great ideas like this and if i had the time I would develop an app for young girls to PREPARE for their first flow as there is so much anxiety, however i love what you are doing to help young girls from different cultures all over the world. Keep doing what you do 💞',	'en'),

My name is Andrew, and I''m a junior at Duke University. I will be working alongside LVCT Health for my Social Innovation Practicum course to research and recommend a business model to sustain roll-out for Period Tracker App in Kenya. I''m a computer science minor and would be interested to access the source code to get a deeper understanding of the app and how to scale this open-source innovation. I''m also curious to hear if there is anything you think would be helpful for our team to know as we begin 2-3 months of research and recommendations. Could you let me know if I can receive access and if you have any other thoughts you would like to share with me and our team?

Thank you so much! I look forward to hearing back from you.

Then he forces he body onto mine and I fall backwards I try to stand up but he''s on me! 😖 Now I''m on the floor and he''s kissing me! I can''t do anything because I don''t want to get stabbed! He starts to reach his hand down my pants but I stop him and say "Dominic you need to stop! Just let me go! " He pulls his hand away and reaches for the knife he is now off of me and I stand up frantically looking for a way out. I run into the jump rope rack and was knocked out cold. 😵 Apparently Dominic heard me crash and saved me by brining me to the nurse. Ha! 😠 I was so angry!

Then I threw one at Dominic and he acted upset but he''s a terrible liar, so I threw another one at him then he went into the closet and pulled out a plastic hockey stick. Now our P. E teacher doesn''t care what we do she is always on her phone so she did nothing about it. Any way Dominic started swinging the hockey stick at me so of course I backed up, I had backed myself up into a corner, but Dominic was still swinging! I was playing Dodge ball with a few other friends who were to busy throwing balls to notice me, except for my other "guy friend" who''s name is Gabe. Any way I tried to get away from Dominic or get the teacher''s attention but we were where no one could see I tried running but Dominic grabbed my arm and with other he waved the hockey stick at me he now had me pushed up against the wall and I had lost my voice from singing so I could only whisper shout. Any way he was pushed up against me and like pelvic thrusting on me and he still had my arm, I thought I was stuck until the end of gym class but that''s when Gabe walked in. He could clearly see I wasn''t choosing to have contact with Dominic so he came in and helped me.  I tried reporting it but no one would listen because the gym teacher said she saw nothing.
